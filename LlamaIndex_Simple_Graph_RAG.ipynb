His work on \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" was intended to conclude the story of the current iteration of the Guardians and to help launch new and existing Marvel characters into the future of the MCU. Despite facing a setback due to offensive statements discovered on his Twitter feed, which led to his temporary firing by Disney, Gunn was eventually rehired to continue his work on the third Guardians film. The film was produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is a sequel to \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\" and it follows the events of \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame.\" The film premiered at Disneyland Paris and had an early screening at Dongdaemun Design Plaza. It was a commercial success, grossing over $845 million worldwide. James Gunn's involvement with the film also extended to curating its soundtrack, which features a diverse range of music spanning multiple decades.</b>"
